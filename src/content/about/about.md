Hi there ✌️ nice to meet you! I'm a _Backend Developer_ based out of Pune, Maharashtra.

I’m currently in my final year of an integrated B.Tech + M.Tech program in Information Technology at IIIT Gwalior. Throughout my studies, I’ve developed a strong passion for understanding the deep internal workings of _operating systems_ and _computer networks_. As a backend developer, I’ve worked on several projects using JavaScript, which has given me practical experience and a solid grasp of coding and problem-solving. I love brainstorming about distributed systems and thinking about how they can be scaled effectively. I primarily code in **C++** and **JavaScript**.

I’m always eager to learn more and collaborate on exciting projects. If you’re interested in tech discussions or have opportunities where I can contribute and grow, let’s connect!
